Hi Everyone!

Today we're going to create a new web application with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).

In this tutorial, a JavaScript Beginner can create a functional Weather App with ease. and won't face any problems doing that.

You must know the basics in JavaScript and HTML, like JavaScript Objects, functions, If statements, ... etc

The only difficulty you might face, is how to work with an API using JavaScript? but trust me that won't be of a big problem.


When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The icons we're going to use for our web application are created by the Graphic Designer Ashley Jager.

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
